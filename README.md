ROS2 Humble + Gazebo simulation of a differential drive mobile robot with sensors and ros2_control integration
# Sampling Robot – ROS2 & Gazebo Simulation

This repository contains a **ROS2 Humble + Gazebo simulation** of a custom-built differential drive mobile robot developed as part of my M.Tech (Robotics & Automation) coursework.

The project focuses on **robot modeling, physics stability, and controller integration**, forming a base platform for future medical robotics applications.
